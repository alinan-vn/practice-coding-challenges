time: 62 minutes

notes: Solved three different ways. First time took me less than 15 minutes, but the issue was the runtime, it took too long to run through the tests. The second solution was faster but alas, not fast enough. The third solution is A LOT faster because I used math to only have to run the samples once rather than 'n' number of times.
